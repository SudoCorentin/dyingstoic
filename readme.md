[@DyincStoic](https://twitter.com/DyingStoic) is a Twitter Bot that posts obituaries of people from all nations and all colors. May paying homage to peopleâ€™s departure inspire you to live well.

It is inspired by the stoic practice of Memento Mori ("Remember You Will Die"), and by newspapers' obituary section.

Note from the author: I started to read obituaries when they featured several of my loved ones. This practice has helped me tremendously to get out of daily dramas and appreciate the finitude of life. Creating DyincStoic stems from my desire to share this others. Now, I realize that republishing obituaries may be seen as insensitive for some, even if it is motivated by good intentions. Every culture differs in their norms related to celebrating the dead. It might be useful to note that most newspapers feature a obituary section. Googling "obituary" will confirm this, along with surfacing hundreds of websites with public obituaries. DyincStoic merely republishes some of them, after removing one's last name and adding a respectful message. If you happen to know someone who is featured by the DyincStoic and would not welcome inspiring the living, I will of course respect their wish and delete the post at once. You may reach me at first.last @ gmail.com, my name being Corentin Trebaol. Also, I sincerely welcome improvement ideas to make DyincStoic as respectful as possible across all cultures. You are more than welcome to email me or to fork this repository and propose your improvements.
Sincerely,
Corentin
